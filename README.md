# StudyNotes

Comprehensive AI/ML study materials featuring structured learning chains for mastering artificial intelligence and machine learning concepts.

## Overview

This repository contains professional-grade educational content covering core AI/ML topics. Each topic follows a **5-Skill Learning Chain** methodology:

```
Study Notes → Concept Map → Flashcards → Practice Problems → Quiz
```

This progressive approach ensures deep understanding through multiple reinforcement strategies.

## Topics Covered

| **Machine Learning** | Supervised/unsupervised learning, algorithms, evaluation metrics | Intermediate |
| **Neural Networks** | Architectures, backpropagation, optimization, regularization | Intermediate |
| **Large Language Models** | Transformers, attention, RLHF, prompting strategies | Advanced |
| **Reinforcement Learning** | MDPs, Q-learning, policy gradients, actor-critic methods | Advanced |
| **Computer Vision** | CNNs, object detection, segmentation, landmark architectures | Advanced |
| **Prompt Engineering** | Techniques for effective LLM interaction | Intermediate |
| **Agentic AI** | Building autonomous AI agents and skills | Advanced |
